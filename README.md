## OUR PROJECT
Since the COVID pandemic, restaurants have shifted their menus to web page versions accessible through a QR code. In order to provide a more informative, interactive and personalized experience when ordering delivery, our tool generates an AR visualization of menu items and allows users to create their own meal, choosing their preferred ingredients and the quantity of such. Once the order is placed through the AR app, this will be received by the restaurant, which will utilize a movable mounted AR display to aid in the chef’s cooking process, thus boosting the restaurant’s accuracy and efficiency in producing meal orders. Our AR app will have two different faces to suit the needs of two major stakeholders in the process: 1) the customer, and 2) the restaurant.
